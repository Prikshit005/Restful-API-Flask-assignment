It acts like a guide or contract between the API provider and users (usually developers), explaining what services are available, how to access them, what kind of data to send or receive, and what responses or errors to expect. It outlines things like the available endpoints (URLs), HTTP methods (like GET or POST), request formats, and response formats (usually in JSON). This helps developers understand how to use the API correctly and consistently, without needing to see the backend code. Popular formats for API specifications include OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) and RAML."

It's popular for building APIs because it is simple, flexible, and doesn't require a lot of setup to get started. With Flask, we can define routes (URLs) and how they should respond to requests using just a few lines of code. It gives us the freedom to choose our tools and structure, making it great for both beginners and experienced developers who want control over how their applications are built. Its simplicity and strong community support make it a go-to choice for creating RESTful APIs."

For example, if someone tries to access a route that doesn’t exist, Flask can return a message like “Page not found” instead of a confusing error. We can also use try-except blocks inside our routes to catch specific issues, such as invalid input, and return a proper JSON response with an error message and status code.

After that, we can create models (classes) that represent tables in our database.
